Hello, my name is Amy Williams. I'm a Front-End Developer, I live in Neath, South Wales. 
I develop using JavaScript/jQuery, HTML/CSS/SCSS and occassionally SQL.

### More Information

I graduate from Swansea University with a First honors degree in Computer Science back in 2013. 
I have been in several jobs doing various jobs such as Android, PHP, e-commerce (Magento) and now purely Front-end development.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning and improving my technical skills by building different projects. So far I have played around with the following: Express.js, React.js, Vue.js, SASS, C# and many more.

I have also an interest with unit testing and automated testing. My goal for this year is to learn more automation testing.

I also attend Swansea Software Development Community (SSDC) meetups on a monthly basis as well as organising to host the first Developer Developer Developer Wales! event. Coming soon March 2018.
